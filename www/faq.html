				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <h4>I try a command from the book and get "<code>Error: could not find function</code> ...". What's up?</h4>
                <p>That means either the command is mistyped, or more likely you need to load a library that enables it.</p>
                <p>Check your typing, and if that doesn't fix it, look back through the chapter for a <code>library()</code> command that you might have missed. To search installed libraries on your system to see which one has the command, you can also use "<code>??</code>".</p>

                <h4>I’m an instructor and considering using <i>R for Marketing Research and Analytics</i> in a class. Are there exercises and course materials available?</h4>
                
                <p><b>Yes!</b> Slides are now available in R markdown (R presentation) format -- with .R code snippets for students to use to follow along, and HTML presentation for the classroom. <a href="Instructor/slides-index.html">Slides are here</a>. Also, we'd be interested to hear about your class. Please send an email to <a href="mailto:eleafeit+bookinstructor@gmail.com">eleafeit+bookinstructor@gmail.com</a>, and let us know what types of students you teach and how you are thinking of using the book.</p>

                <p>Note that the primary goal of this book is a text to help professionals who work with marketing data to master R. Of course, students are future professionals and we think the book will be useful to them, too.</p>
                
                <p>If you want your students to develop strong R skills, we suggest using the book in a “workshop” format course where students sit at computers and work together through the examples with guidance from an instructor. We are also assembling a set of exercises for each chapter that can be used for evaluating students mastery of the material.</p>
